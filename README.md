# Week6Challenge
RoboResume v4

Assignment:

 Continue the Robo Resume application from Week 5.

Deploy this one to Heroku as well.

Add Security (I should be able to log in with username: newuser and password: newuserpa$$)

A user, once logged in, should be able to create resumes for many  people.

You should also have a page to list the users whose resumes have been entered. Clicking the link should show you the summary page, and allow you to edit details for that user.

Bonus points:

Create a list of courses, and allow newuser to register students for those courses.
